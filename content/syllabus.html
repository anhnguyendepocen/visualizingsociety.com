<h2 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h2>
<p>This class will teach you how to use modern, widely-used tools to create beautiful, understandable, reproducible visualizations of social science data.</p>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course materials</h2>
<p>I recommend (but do not require) you buy two books:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="citation">Kieran Healy, <em>Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2019), <a href="http://socviz.co/">http://socviz.co/</a>.</span> [Draft version free online; print version at <a href="https://amzn.to/2vfAixM">Amazon</a>]</li>
<li><span class="citation">Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, <em>R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data</em> (Sebastopol, California: O’Reilly Media, 2017), <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">http://r4ds.had.co.nz/</a>.</span> [Free online; print version at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/">Amazon</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="citation">Claus E. Wilke, <em>Fundamentals of Data Visualization</em> (Sebastopol, California: O’Reilly Media, 2019), <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/">https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/</a>.</span> [Draft version free online; print version at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Visualization-Informative-Compelling/dp/1492031089">Amazon</a>, forthcoming]</li>
</ul>
<p>There will also occasionally be additional material to read. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the reading page for that week.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend subscribing to the <a href="https://rweekly.org/">R Weekly newsletter</a>. This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.</p>
<h3 id="r-and-rstudio">R and RStudio</h3>
<p>You will do all of your visualization work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.</p>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free <a href="http://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio.cloud</a> service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.</p>
