Most weeks you will do an assignment that either reflects on the readings or lets you practice your R skills in a problem set, or both. To submit an assignment, Save it with a name of the form `lastname_firstname_ps01` and upload it to the Sakai dropbox for the course. 

Look to the list of assignments on the left, under "Work", to see what is currently due.
